After a long night I waited,
I got something to get excited...

It had bloom,
from the mask of gloom...

Painting my world,
With its rays in gold...

I'm the life in nature,
Wanted to interview the life of nature...

"Good morning", I wished.
I'm re-wished by a hug of warmness, shattering the cold...

Then I asked, "What can I call u?"
It was silent for a while and replied, Call me mother my child, Coz I m the one who takes care of all ur needs and greeds"...

Suddenly a soothing wind touched me lifting up my emotions...

Then I asked, "Are u the one whom we call GOD"
SHE smiled and replied, "No I m not GOD. I m appointed by GOD, to sail the ships of his children in the river of time. To irrigate his field where he has sown the seeds of life."

During our conversation, gradually the sky covered itself with a grey blanket and tiny showers started tickling my spirits...

Then she continued,
"GOD gave me life, I have designed innumerable races"

"GOD gave me silence, I wrote music on it"
A gurgling sound of rain drops danced at my ears...

"GOD gave me light, I have found millions of colors from it"
A beautiful rainbow appeared shooting its arrow of beauty into my eyes...

"Finally, GOD gave me a rock and I turned it into a beautiful blue planet"

I listened to her mouth-agape. She clapped with a thunder and asked me, "Any more questions my child?"

I was back to myself and asked, "Is there anything u feel special and proud in this genesis?"

"Yes!!!" She replied, "GOD gave me some ambrosia which I sprinkled it all over to kill the evil and build his field. That is nothing but LOVE"...

It stopped raining. I felt I was completely wet in her raining love...

I could hear some frolic sounds of birds
I could see some colors flying as butterflies
I could feel the chilling wind, carrying the fragrance of blooming flowers...
Its really Ecstatic...

Some tiny twinkles started peeking through the sky.
She said, "I have a great time with you my dear. Its getting dark and time to leave"
With a hard smile on my face I said "GUD BYE"...

She closed her eyes and dipped into the ocean of Silence n Darkness...

Soon I felt somebody patting my back. It was my mother waking me up...
I thought that was the real awakening for me.
My dream sensed me that a lovable mother is now born to this innocent child.
From that day I started enjoying the nature, Share my feeling with it, Play with it...

My dream had boon me A teacher, A friend and above all "A MOTHER"...:)
