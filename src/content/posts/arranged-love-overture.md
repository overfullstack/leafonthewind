“And then, saw her for the first time, walking, a long shot, in slow motion”, it starts here, whenever I glimpse back into our memories.
“What’s the difference between Marriage and Wedding?”, her first question. Gosh! I felt, should have googled this along with ‘How to impress a girl?’, before meeting her for the first time.

I stretched my arms and folded them behind my head, staring at her Pencil Painting I drew for her birthday…

Where should I start? Out of all those billions of words exchanged, raining and vaporizing, cycling and recycling, the ocean of feelings, as I pen this long story about our short journey 😇
