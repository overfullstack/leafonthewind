We all make journeys. Journeys of meters and kilometers. But I made a journey of seconds, hours, days and decades. My ride started with pride that died in the end...
This is my "Journey of Time"...

My papa invented a 'time machine',
And that resolved my passion...
I stepped-in to enjoy that lovely arcade,
And went forward for a long decade...

Surprise surprise all over surprise,
Everywhere wonders that the world comprise...
Then I walked into a broad-wide road,
where I couldn't find a single grass node...

Pollution population raised my emotion,
I was hardly breathing for a bit of oxygen...
Though the technology has developed,
The society looked enveloped...

wealth is there but the health is rare
I tip-toed myself into a home ,
Where I heard a mom's tone...
Bobby! Did u get your carriage, Yes mom!
Did u get your water bottle,Yes mom!
Did u get your oxygen cylinder...!!!
No mom its empty...:(

Blue skies are bleeding with Acid rains,
Giant jungles are now under the jaws of saws...
No water body I see, No big tree I see,
No beautiful bird I see,No soothing wind I see...
But I saw one that made me stun,
A Zoo where dogs,Pigs and Crows are grown...

I returned to my papa in a haste,
And told about the life that has no taste...
I requested him to invent a machine,
To forget everything I have seen...:(
