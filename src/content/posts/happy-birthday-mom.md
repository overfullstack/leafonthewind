Happy Birthday to,
The one who gave me this birth,
whom I always love to be with...

Happy Birthday to,
The one on this earth who felt me first,
and gave me a touch of love and trust...

Happy Birthday to,
The one who stood by my falling steps,
and gave me a pat in my downs n ups...

Happy Birthday to,
The one who taught me the life lessons,
and made me feel their lively essence...

Happy Birthday to,
The one I feel so special in this world,
No matter time turns us young or old...

Happy Birthday to,
The one who cherished my past and present,
MOM is whom, GOD gave me as a present...

Amma!!! U r the loveliest person,
And I m so lucky to be your son...:)
